The app has four fragments (home, heroes, query and quiz), where you can:

Heroes - Here you can view your saved heroes and see details and facts about them. With 5 or more saved heroes the "Start the quiz" button appears!

Query - Heroes are loaded here from Marvel's Comics API! Use the search bar to filter and save your favorite heroes!

Quiz - Seven randomized questions about the details and facts you studied earlier! Retake the quiz if you want better results, or end the quiz and return to the heroes fragment.
